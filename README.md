# Project to Explore Change in Elk Horn Coal Hunting Access Area in Eastern KY
The Elk Horn Coal Hunting Access Area covers more than 20,000 acres across Floyd, Knott, Letcher, and Pike Counties in eastern Kentucky. Once dominated by surface mining, this landscape has undergone significant ecological change over the last few decades. Managed through a public-private partnership between the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources and the Elk Horn Coal Company, the site was opened to the public in 2018 for regulated hunting and outdoor recreation. Today, its steep ridges and valleys are covered in a mix of dense forest and recovering shrubland, visible through high NDVI values across the region.
