        <h3>Overview & History</h3>
    
        <p>
          The Elk Horn Coal Hunting Access Area spans over 20,000 acres across
          Floyd, Knott, Letcher, and Pike Counties in Eastern Kentucky. Once 
          home to extensive strip mining and mountaintop removal across 
          Appalachia, this land was reclaimed through a public-private 
          partnership and opened for public hunting and recreation in 2018. 
          Today, it is a mix of The property is comprised of reclaimed strip
          mine habitat of grasses and shrubs, with timbered ridges and 
          drainages throughout. Strip mine habitat is of varying age and 
          classification of reclamation. Officially still owned by a Elk Horn
          Coal, but managed by the Kentucky Department of Fish & Wildlife
          Resources for public use through hunting.
        </p>
          
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to visualize the multiple changes in 
          topography and land cover across the site using elevation models, 
          NDVI, and land cover classification. The area may appear green 
          today, but it was not always this way. These maps help reveal the
          scars of mining, the scale of valley fills and recontoured ridges,
          and the regrowth of vegetation in areas once stripped bare.
        </p>

        <h3>How does each map tell a story of change?</h3>

        <p>Shaded Relief with NDVI (2022)


          Map 1 combines a shaded relief base with NDVI data to show the 
          current state of vegetation in the Elk Horn Coal Hunting Access 
          Area. Darker greens indicate healthier vegetation, while lighter 
          tones and gray patches highlight less vegetated or developed areas, 
          such as roads and reclaimed mine benches. The mix of high and low 
          NDVI values reflects a patchy landscape still recovering from 
          decades of surface mining. The rugged terrain and vegetation 
          gradients offer a snapshot of how the site looks today.
        </p>

        <p>
          Elevation Change (1990s-2010s):


          Map 2 visualizes elevation change over roughly two decades, 
          revealing how mining reshaped the land. Pink areas show where 
          mountaintops were removedâ€”flattened for coal extractionâ€”while 
          green areas represent valley fills where excess material was 
          dumped. The clearest patterns of change trace the linear paths 
          of former strip mines and fill benches. This topographic 
          evidence helps us understand the physical legacy of mining 
          across Eastern Kentuckyâ€™s ridgelines and hollows.
        </p>

        <p>
          Land Cover Change (2001-2019):


          Map 3 is a land cover change map, which highlights areas that transitioned from 
          shrubland or grassland to forest between 2001 and 2019. Dark green 
          pixels show regrowthâ€”evidence of either natural succession or 
          reclamation planting on former mine sites. While not uniform across 
          the landscape, this forest recovery is concentrated along slopes and 
          access corridors, indicating selective regrowth in areas no longer 
          disturbed. It demonstrates how the land, though still owned by Elk 
          Horn Coal, is slowly rewilding for public use.
